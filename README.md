# Design-Patterns
a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. 

A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. 
It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.


## Types of Design Patterns


### 1. Creational Patterns
Creational patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, providing ways to create objects in a manner suitable for 
a particular situation. They help decouple the client code from the object creation process, promoting flexibility and extensibility.


- **Singleton:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. 
- 


### 2. Structural Patterns
- **Flyweight:** "that lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object".
-

### 3. Behavioral Patterns
- **Strategy:** Defines a family of interchangeable algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable at runtime.
